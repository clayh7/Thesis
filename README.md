# Thesis
I set out to craft a MMO ARPG from scratch with my own custom C++ engine in 8 months.
All of the code, art, and design was made by me.

Networking System Features:
- Reliable and Unreliable packages
- Ordered and Unordered packages
- Dedicated Server/Listen Server
  - Headless Dedicated Server
- Supports up to ~71 people concurrently

Added debugging overlay for:
- Client-Side Prediction

Game features:
- Networking System
- Player Accounts
- Base Classes (3)
- Leveling System
- UI System
- Persistent World
- Lock-on
- Evil Class (1)
- Evil NPCs
- Boss NPCs
- Crystal Core
- Good NPCs
- Cthulhu Class (1)
- Primary Weapons
- Warping
- Communication
- Partical System

Future Work:
- Entity Component System
- Adaptive Quality of Service
- Multithread Packet Filling
- Delta Compression
- UI Layers

Takeaways
- Approach game creation cocentrically
  - Start with a small core, and keep adding layers
- It takes 3 to 4 times longer to implement networked gameplay features
- Actual playtesting is difficult
- Debugging, Debugging, Debugging
  - Make yourself tools early and often, visualizing problems makes them easier to solve
